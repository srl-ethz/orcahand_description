# Orcahand Description

This repository contains the description files for the Orcahand model (Both URDF and MJCF). The 'extended' version contains additional bodies (incl. inertial properties) such as the camera mount, the U2D2 board and fans.

## Example Usage: Visualize MJCF
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:orcahand/orcahand_description.git
   cd orcahand_description
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install mujoco
   ```
3. Simulate the orcahand in mujoco:
   ```bash
   python3 -m mujoco.viewer --mjcf=scene_combined.xml
   ```

## Example Usage: Visualize URDF in RViz
1. Clone the repository to your ROS2 workspace
   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws/src
   git clone git@github.com:orcahand/orcahand_description.git
   ```
2. Build the workspace and source it
   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws
   colcon build --symlink-install
   source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
   ```
3. Launch the sample script
   ```bash
   ros2 launch orcahand_description orcahand_xacro.launch.py chirality:=right
   ```
   Rviz2 opens and you can modify the joint angles with the slider.

## Note on Meshes
Visual meshes contain the following amount of faces:
- Main tower, camera & fans: 15'000
- Rest of base: 2'000
- Skin: 5'000
- Rest: 500

Collision meshes contain the following amount of faces:
- Main tower, camera & fans: 7500
- Rest of base: 1000
- Skin: 500
- Rest: 250

You can further reduce or mirror meshes using the `utils/mesh_utils.py` script. With the same script, you can also print their number of faces. Some extra dependencies are required:
```bash
cd utils
pip install -r utils_requirements.txt
```

We can also recommend the VSCode extension `mtsmfm.vscode-stl-viewer` for quickly visualizing STL meshes.
